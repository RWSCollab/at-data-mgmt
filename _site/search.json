    "section": "1. Planning & Coordination Steps",
    "text": "1. Planning & Coordination Steps\nPlanning steps include pre-deployment coordination and communication best practices that help ensure that any new deployments are responsive to acoustic telemetry data gaps and needs in the region (to the extent practicable), and that individuals or entities responsible for deployments and data are connected to the existing network of experts and can benefit from lessons learned and other existing bodies of knowledge.\n\nI. Engage with the RWSC Protected Fish Species or Sea Turtle Subcommittees and Responsible Offshore Science Alliance\nGroups or individuals planning to deploy acoustic telemetry receivers and/or tag animals on the Atlantic OCS are encouraged to attend RWSC Subcommittee meetings to introduce their project, discuss their deployment plan with experts, and receive input on optimal location and other considerations (visit https://rwsc.org/events to view the Subcommittee meeting schedule).\n\n\n\nII. Add acoustic telemetry instrument metadata to the RWSC Research Planning Map\nIn collaboration with ACT, ROSA and the Subcommittees are maintaining an understanding of acoustic telemetry receivers deployed on the Atlantic OCS and periodically updating maps that show current deployments on the RWSC Research Planning Map.\nThe maps are developed from location and deployment information shared by principal investigators and ACT. The following best practices ensure that information about new and completed deployments is shared so that the maps maintain their accuracy and relevance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Practices\n\n\n\n\nShare any instrument metadata using the template provided by ACT.\nSend the completed Instrument Metadata form to admin@rwsc.org for inclusion in the Acoustic Telemetry Layer of the RWSC Research Planning Map.\n\n\n\nThe Research Planning Map and regional ocean data portals (https://www.northeastoceandata.org, https://portal.midatlanticocean.org) also contain data products that may assist funders and researchers in selecting locations for receiver deployment. For example, the Research Planning Map and Portals contain data products representing monthly and annual vessel traffic for several classes of vessels; commercial fishing activity; offshore wind planning and leasing areas; and bathymetry and seafloor composition information. The Subcommittees encourages users to examine these data to inform acoustic telemetry receiver deployment site selection.\n\n\n\nIII. Codeployment of other sensors\nIntroducing new instruments and moorings into the environment presents an opportunity to co-locate other sensors and equipment. For example, several active and planned PAM deployments include support for acoustic telemetry receiver devices. This type of co-deployment builds the receiver network for studies of other taxa such as sea turtles and highly migratory fish species, and is strongly encouraged.\nWhile the location of PAM instruments and moored PAM arrays may not represent ideal receiver locations needed to address research questions answered with acoustic telemetry for other taxa, RWSC and its partners encourage the deployment of multiple sensors per mooring, when practicable, while research questions and best practices for acoustic telemetry are under development.\nIn August 2022, the RWSC Sea Turtle Subcommittee recommended that acoustic telemetry receivers be included on each new PAM deployment as the RWSC Marine Mammal Subcommittee considers the design and implementation of a regional PAM network.\nThe locations of actively deployed PAM sensors on the Atlantic OCS can be viewed in the RWSC Research Planning Map. Clicking on each point will open a popup box that indicates whether an acoustic telemetry receiver is codeployed with the PAM hydrophone.\n\n\n\nMap showing current passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) for baleen whales deployments in U.S. Atlantic waters. The highlighted instrument location north of Georges Bank shows a codeployed VR2AR (acoustic receiver) and FPOD (sensor to detect dolphin clicks). View an interactive version of this map: https://rwsc.org/map/?link=c8XVYns3.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. Participate in Regional Telemetry Networks and set project to “public”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Practices\n\n\n\n\nParticipate in the regional acoustic telemetry network for the study area (e.g., Atlantic Cooperative Telemetry Network (ACT), FACT Network, Ocean Tracking Network (OTN)).\nProject data and metadata submitted to regional telemetry networks should be set to “public”.\n\n\n\nParticipation involves submitting all completed data products and metadata forms (templates provided by ACT).\nVisit the ACT Network’s Data Portal, MATOS (https://matos.asascience.com), for the mid-Atlantic and Northeast U.S. or FACT (https://secoora.org/fact) for the Southeast U.S. for more information including User Agreements.\n\n\n\nV. Navy awareness of acoustic telemetry receiver deployments on the Atlantic OCS\nThe purpose of the following steps is to ensure that the US Navy is aware of and can provide feedback on the precise location of bottom-mounted acoustic monitoring equipment on the Atlantic OCS. The Navy is requesting that all individuals consider the following steps prior to deployment. Developers may be subject to additional requirements under the BOEM issued permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Practice\n\n\n\nRWSC periodically shares data from the Research Planning Map directly with Beth Levy, Program Coordinator for the US Navy’s Ocean Observing Systems Situational Awareness Office (OOS SAO), so that the Navy may operate safely in the vicinity of deployed sensors.\n\n\nInvestigators may also email Beth Levy directly to share deployment plans for US Navy awareness: beth.m.levy2.ctr@us.navy.mil"

    "text": "2. Deployment & Data Collection\nThis document recognizes that deployment and data collection steps are likely specifically established by entities deploying instruments and collecting data; and in some case these procedures could be proprietary. The following steps outline minimum considerations for ensuring that data being collected by various entities around the region can eventually be collated and analyzed in the future to examine regional-scale questions or issues of interest.\n\n\nVI. Calibration best practices and minimum specifications\n[to be populated with content from Bowers, et al. in prep]\n\n\n\nVII. Best practices for acoustic telemetry data QA/QC\n[to be populated with content from Bowers, et al. in prep]\nRegional acoustic telemetry networks provide data standardization and QA/QC services by acoustic telemetry data experts for all datasets in their network. This provides accuracy and consistency for researchers and analysts working with big datasets and saves time. This makes the data easier to use, and guarantees the data is stored somewhere other than a local drive, preventing accidental data loss. It also ensures that all data is standardized and analysis-ready. See the section on Participation in Regional Telemetry Networks."
